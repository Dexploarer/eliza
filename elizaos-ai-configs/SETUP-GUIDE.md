# ElizaOS AI Configuration Setup Guide

## Quick Start

You now have comprehensive ElizaOS development configurations for all major AI coding tools.

## Setup Instructions by Tool

### 1. Windsurf IDE
**Copy to your ElizaOS project:**
- Copy `.windsurf/` directory to your project root
- Rules will automatically apply to Cascade AI interactions
- Use workflows with `/elizaos-development`, `/elizaos-testing`, etc.

### 2. Claude Code
**Copy to your ElizaOS project:**
- Copy `.claude/` directory to your project root
- Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your project root
- Commands available: `/project:dev`, `/project:test`, `/project:elizaos:action`, etc.

### 3. OpenAI Codex (Cloud & CLI)
**Cloud Version (ChatGPT):**
- Copy `codex/CODEX.md` to your project root
- Codex will automatically detect and apply rules

**CLI Version:**
- Follow instructions in `codex/config-setup.md`
- Configure ~/.codex/ directory with global instructions

### 4. GitHub Copilot
**Copy to your ElizaOS project:**
- Copy `github-copilot/.github/` to your project root
- Copy `github-copilot/.vscode/` to your project root (for VS Code users)
- Instructions automatically apply to all Copilot requests

### 5. Cursor IDE
**Choose one approach:**

**Legacy (Simpler):**
- Copy `cursor/.cursorrules` to your project root

**Modern (Recommended):**
- Copy `cursor/.cursor/` directory to your project root
- Provides context-aware rules

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Development** - Same ElizaOS patterns across all AI tools
✅ **Quality Enforcement** - Automatic validation of development principles
✅ **Architecture Compliance** - All tools understand ElizaOS constraints
✅ **Complete Coverage** - From planning to implementation to testing

## What's Included

- **Flow - Always Plan First** methodology enforcement
- **No Stubs or Incomplete Code** validation
- **Test-Driven Development** with elizaos commands
- **Bun Runtime** and TypeScript standards
- **Component Specifications** (Actions, Providers, Evaluators, etc.)
- **Architecture Abstractions** (Channel→Room, Server→World mappings)

## Next Steps

1. Choose which AI tools you want to use
2. Copy the appropriate configuration directories to your ElizaOS project
3. Start coding with AI assistance that understands ElizaOS deeply!

All tools will now automatically apply the same development standards and architectural constraints, ensuring consistent, high-quality code regardless of which AI tool you're using.
